# Denial Of Service
An exploitation
of the DoS vulnerability makes a smart contracts unavailable for service on the Ethereum network. The major scenarios that
can make a smart contract vulnerable to DoS attack are highlighted below:

## scenarios
The following scenarios shows the usage of built-in functions suicide() and selfdestruct() without checking the ownership of 
the smart contract or access permissions.

```
function kill(address malicious) external {
    suicide(malicious);
    }
```

```
function kill(address malicious) external {
    selfdestruct(malicious);
    }
```

The below scenario shows the usage of the external call function send() inside a for-statement. If the send() function fails to execute, 
then the transaction is reverted and the loop is halted and make the smart contract unavailable for service.
```
function sendPayments() public returns (bool){
         for(uint i=0;i<n;i++) {
            addresses.send(msg.sender);
        }    return true;
    }
```
Finally, the below scenario shows the usage of the built-in function require() inside a for-statement. The require() function takes a condition 
that cannot be detected until execution time.
```
function sendPayments() public returns (bool){
         for(uint i=0;i<n;i++) {
             require(addresses.send(msg.sender));
        }    
        return true;
    }
```
