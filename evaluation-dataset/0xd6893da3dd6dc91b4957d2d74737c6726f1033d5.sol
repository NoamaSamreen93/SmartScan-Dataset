  1. Send any non-zero amount to the contract address
     - amount from 0.01 to 2 ETH
     - gas limit minimum 250,000
     - you'll be in line.
  2. Wait a little
  3. ...
  4. PROFIT! You received 150% of your Deposit.

  How is that possible?
  1. The first investor in the queue (you will be the first very soon) receives payments from
     new investors until they receive 150% of their Deposit
  2. Payments can come in several parts or all at once
  3. Once you receive 150% of your Deposit, you are removed from the queue
  4. You can make multiple deposits at once
  5. The balance of this contract shall usually be in area 0, because all of the proceeds
     immediately sent to the payment

     Thus, the latter pay first, and investors who have reached 150% of the Deposit,
     are removed from the queue, giving way to the rest

                new investor --|               brand new investor --|
                 investor5     |                 new investor       |
                 investor4     |     =======>      investor5        |
                 investor3     |                   investor4        |
                 investor2    <|                   investor3        |
                 investor1   <-|                   investor2   <----|  (pay until 150%)
