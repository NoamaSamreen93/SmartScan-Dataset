 * - customizing request parameters: In the OptimisticOracle, parameters like `bond` and `customLiveness` can be reset
 *   after a request is already made via `requestPrice`. In the SkinnyOptimisticOracle, these parameters can only be
 *   set in `requestPrice`, which has an expanded input set.
 * - settleAndGetPrice: Replaced by `settle`, which can only be called once per settleable request. The resolved price
 *   can be fetched via the `Settle` event or the return value of `settle`.
 * - general changes to interface: Functions that interact with existing requests all require the parameters of the
 *   request to modify to be passed as input. These parameters must match with the existing request parameters or the
 *   function will revert. This change reflects the internal refactor to store hashed request parameters instead of the
 *   full request struct.

 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
